# Book List Project
This project allows the user to enter books they have read to keep track of. This site is simple but effective.


## Table of Contents
1. Is your site targeted to a specific group of users? If so, what are the demographics of that group?
- This site is targeted at users who want a simple interface to track books. It’s small and dynamic enough to load on everything from a desktop computer to a smart toaster.

2. What were some design considerations that you took into account when you designed
your site?
- I wanted to make my website very simple. I often find bloated websites with heavy UI elements that make my computer’s fans spin up for no apparent reason. Also, I didn’t want to burden the user with unnecessary hoops to jump through just to enter in book titles.

3. Refer to Schneiderman’s eight heuristics for interface design. Which did you consider in your site and how?
- My web page is a collage of different standard website templates. This ensures that the user is working on something very familiar which follows Schneiderman’s first rule: Strive for Consistency. 

4. What about your interface do you think is particularly appealing? Is there anything that you think could be improved upon?
- My interface works well at this scale. However, if it were to be scaled up with a database running in the background, I would need to incorporate more informative feedback while entries undergo CRUD operation.

5. Identify at least one accordance and one constraint in your site and explain how they are made visible.
- Accordance: All fields are labled and should be intuitive for people who can read. Furthermore, the delete button is red which acts as a visual alert to the action that the button can perform.
- Constraint: The field that requests a date can only accept a four digit number. This prevents the user from entering letters into this data field.
